# Facial Recognition based Attendance Marking System
## Objectives 

- To digitalize the existing attendance marking system.
- To improvise the tedious procedure traditionally adopted.
- To maintain transparency with respect to attendance hence marked. 

## Facial Recognition
Facial recognition is a way of recognizing a human face through technology. A facial recognition system uses biometrics to map facial features from a photograph or video. It compares the information with a database of known faces to find a match.

## Our Approach

- To build a  system based on a special type of CNN architecture known as a siamese network. Such a network is trained to generate a very accurate and almost unique 128 vector given that the images of face which are fed to the network are properly aligned and cropped.
